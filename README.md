# lazyShortcutClassroom
Implementing my first script that could access my zoomiiies lessons. 


## Fight against a passCode
This year all zoomies class aren't accessible just from the link. I used to manage those links with google calendar that could have the possibility to import the unicalendar from moodle. It was all funs and games till passcode. Worst day of my life, we went from 2 click which were extremly comfortable to an intricate Cnosso maze.
ITS TIME TO CHANGE. Nobody can destroy OUR humble laziness.

## Utilities
I'm so sorry about that but the only one person that can use with his own optimization with the screen is ME :(
but if you want you can costumize on your own.
